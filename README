a2jmidid is daemon for exposing legacy ALSA sequencer applications in
JACK MIDI system.

It is based on jack-alsamidi-0.5 (jackd alsa seq midi backend) by
Dmitry Baikov.

The main purpose is to ease usage of legacy, not JACK-ified apps, in
JACK MIDI enabled systems.

If someone wants to contribute please, contact me (Nedko Arnaudov), or
send patches, or request inclusion (Gna! a2jmidid project).

Packagers are more than welcome too.
